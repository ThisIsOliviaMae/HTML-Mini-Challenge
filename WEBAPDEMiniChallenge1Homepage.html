			<p>The picture above basically describes me in a nutshell.</p>
			<p>
				Mama told me not to waste my life She said spread your wings my little butterfly
				<br />Don't let what they say keep you up at night And if they give you shhhh... Then they can walk on by
				<br />My feet, feet can't touch the ground And I can't hear a sound But you just keep on running up your mouth yeah
				<br />Walk, walk on over there 'Cause I'm too fly to care, oh yeah
				<br />Your words don't mean a thing I'm not listening Keep talking, all I know is
				<br />Mama told me not to waste my life, She said spread your wings my little butterfly Don't let what they say keep you up at night And they can't detain you 'Cause wings are made to fly And we don't let nobody bring us down No matter what you say  it won't hurt me Don't matter if I fall from the sky These wings are made to fly
				<br />(Hey, hey, woo!)
				<br />I'm firing up on that runway I know we're gonna get there someday But we don't need no "Ready. Steady. Go!", no
				<br />Talk, talk turns into air And I don't even care, oh yeah
				<br />Your words don't mean a thing I'm not listening Keep talking, all I know is
				<br />Mama told me not to waste my life, She said spread your wings my little butterfly Don't let what they say keep you up at night And they can't detain you 'Cause wings are made to fly And we don't let nobody bring us down No matter what you say  it won't hurt me Don't matter if I fall from the sky These wings are made to fly
				<br />I don't need no one saying hey, hey, hey, hey I don't hear no one saying hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey You better keep on walking I don't wanna hear your talking, boy'd You better keep on walking I don't wanna hear your talking, boy'd
				<br />Your words don't mean a thing I'm not listening They're just like water off my wings
				<br />Mama told me not to waste my life, She said spread your wings my little butterfly Don't let what they say keep you up at night And they can't detain you 'Cause wings are made to fly And we don't let nobody bring us down No matter what you say  it won't hurt me Don't matter if I fall from the sky These wings are made to fly
				<br />And we don't let nobody bring us down No matter what you say  it won't hurt me Don't matter if I fall from the sky These wings are made to fly
